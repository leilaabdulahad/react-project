## About the project
This eCommerce project was initiated as part of the a course assignment, serving as a practical application of the concepts learned. As the project evolves, it continues to be a valuable learning opportunity, allowing for the exploration and application of various skills.

For state management, Redux Toolkit has been selected to efficiently handle the complexities of the application's data flow. This decision aligns with the project's goal of maintaining a robust and scalable architecture.

Currently, the project is in an active development phase, with ongoing improvements and features being added. It is a dynamic endeavor that I plan to dedicate time to in the upcoming months, ensuring its growth and refinement. Stay tuned for exciting updates as the project unfolds and matures.
